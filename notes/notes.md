>In a functional paradigm, you don’t tell the computer what to do but rather you tell it what stuff is.


>If a function is called twice with the same parameters, it’s guaranteed to return the same result. This is called **referential transparency**.

>Typically, in functional programming, we do not use loops. We use recursion.

lazy evaluation

function type notation as a -> b

### Which langauge(s)?

>For programming languages in this paradigm go with Elm for frontends and Haskell for anything else in production (it's a bit harder to get into due to the ecosystem). For fun cutting-edge stuff check out Idris, Agda or ATS (fun warning about ATS).



Functional Programming: What Language Should You Be Talking? (https://hackernoon.com/functional-programming-what-language-should-you-be-talking-313dd8bc379b)


>‘a style of building structure and elements’ of a computer program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

key difference is in using a ‘declarative’ approach, versus an ‘imperative approach’used in other programming methodologies. 

map, reduce

>Moloney champions Scala, Python, and JavaScript, depending on the circumstances. “Given that I work in the Big Data and data science domain, Scala has been a versatile language. Apache Spark is the most popular distributed data processing framework, and Spark is written in Scala.

>Lambda calculus (λ-calculus), originally created by Alonzo Church, is the world's smallest programming language. Despite not having numbers, strings, booleans, or any non-function datatype, lambda calculus can be used to represent any Turing Machine!

Lambda calculus is composed of 3 elements: variables, functions, and applications.
