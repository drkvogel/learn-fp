>in purely functional languages, a function has no side-effects. The only thing a function can do is calculate something and return it as a result.

if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the same result. That's called referential transparency

Haskell is lazy
allows you to think of programs as a series of transformations on data. It also allows cool things such as infinite data structures.

statically typed
type inference
