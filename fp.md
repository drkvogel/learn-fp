>In a functional paradigm, you don’t tell the computer what to do but rather you tell it what stuff is.


>If a function is called twice with the same parameters, it’s guaranteed to return the same result. This is called **referential transparency**.

>Typically, in functional programming, we do not use loops. We use recursion.

lazy evaluation

function type notation as a -> b

### Which langauge(s)?

>For programming languages in this paradigm go with Elm for frontends and Haskell for anything else in production (it's a bit harder to get into due to the ecosystem). For fun cutting-edge stuff check out Idris, Agda or ATS (fun warning about ATS).



Functional Programming: What Language Should You Be Talking? (https://hackernoon.com/functional-programming-what-language-should-you-be-talking-313dd8bc379b)


>‘a style of building structure and elements’ of a computer program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

key difference is in using a ‘declarative’ approach, versus an ‘imperative approach’used in other programming methodologies. 

map, reduce
