Any function has 2 aspects: the value it returns and the effects it had. Effects include IO operations and reassignments/state changes, basically anything that is done (a++) rather than declared (a + 1).

A monad represent effects as plain data. Rather than doing the effect, it is information about what the effect is.

a monad is also a generic wrapping around a value, i.e. that which was originally returned, allowing us to extract the value from the monad if and only if everything went well.

in functional program, code is data too 
(functions are first-class citizens)
functions are the bread and butter
you can convert any function into a table lookup?
think all noun-y, no verb-y...
f#, haskell, erlang...
no shared mutable state
haskell - no mutable state at all
can simulate mutable state with monads...
he says "mow-nads"...
4 steps:
Functions
Monoids - you don't know the word, but you know what they are...
Functions
Monads
"this stuff is easy"
terse notation
in imperative programming:
   int x; # x has type 'int'
in functional programming:
   x: int # x is a member of the set of ints
